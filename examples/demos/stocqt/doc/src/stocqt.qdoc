    The \e{StocQt} application presents trend charts for a custom
    list of 100 stocks based on the NASDAQ-100. It allows the user to choose stocks
    from a list, and fetch the required data from the Financial Modeling Prep API using QNetworkAccessManager or from an offline dataset.
    The application also allows for favoriting up to 5 stocks for use in comparison charts.

    The application uses several custom types such as Search, StockCheckBox,
    StockChart, StockView, and SettingsView. These types
    present the stock data in a readable form and let the user customize
    the trend chart. For example, the user can choose to view the weekly,
    monthly, quarterly, or half-yearly trends in the stock price.

    The application uses a custom StockEngine singleton implemented in C++ for data handling,
    such as API requests and favoriting stocks. It implements a custom APIHandler class for fetching the online data.

    The application uses the ObjectModel type to access visual data models that it depends on.

    \skipto model
    \printuntil SettingsView

    \printuntil }

    The StockListModel is a custom data model listing the
    stocks with basic information such as stock ID, name, value,
    and favorite. This application uses this data model when the
    user wants to choose another stock from the list.

    StockView and FavoriteView are complex data models that present a trend chart for the
    selected stock or a group of up to 5 stocks. They use another custom type, StockChart or FavoriteChart,
    which loads the data from the StockEngine into ListModels and presents
    the graphical trend of the stock price using a Surface3D, Bars3D, or Scatter3D.

    \dots 8
    \skipto Surface3D
    \printuntil id
    \dots 8
    \skipto Surface3DSeries
    \printuntil ,

    The SettingsView presents information on the application as well as a dropdown menu for
    choosing between offline and live data. Using live data also requires the user to provide an API
    key. A personal API key can be generated from the \l{http://financialmodelingprep.com/}
    {Financial Modeling Prep website}, which can then be inserted into the API key prompt seen when
    choosing to use live data.

    To understand the application better, browse through its code using
    Qt Creator.
