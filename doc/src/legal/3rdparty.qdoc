    \title Third-Party Licenses Used in Qt
    \ingroup licensing
    \brief License information for third-party libraries supplied with Qt.

    Qt includes a number of third-party libraries that are used to provide
    certain features. Unlike the code described in the
    \l{Other Licenses Used in Qt} document, these libraries are supplied
    alongside the Qt modules. For an overview of Qt licensing and a list of
    all third-party code in Qt, see \l {Qt Licensing}.

    Third Party Software may impose additional restrictions and it is the
    user's responsibility to ensure that they have met the licensing
    requirements of the LGPL or Qt Commercial license and the relevant
    license of the Third Party Software they are using.

    Run \c{configure -help} to see any options that may be available for
    controlling the use of these libraries.

    Modifications, if any, done to the third-party libraries can
    normally be found by reviewing the change history of the
    corresponding files in the public Qt repository.

    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an

    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or
    Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for
    which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or

    shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely
    link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and

    perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
    irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative

    licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by
    their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their

    submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
    that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
    constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
    patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
    shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
    meet the following conditions: You must give any other recipients
    of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

    You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that You changed the files; and

    You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that
    You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution
    notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices
    that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

    If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of
    the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as
    part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
    the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not
    modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices
    within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an
    addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such
    additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying
    the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your
    modifications and may provide additional or different license
    terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of
    Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
    provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work
    otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.


    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state
    otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion
    in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
    conditions of this License, without any additional terms or
    conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
    supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement

    the NOTICE file.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
    conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS
    FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
    determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the
    Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
    permissions under this License.

    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
    special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
    arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
    to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of
    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
    and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
    Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
    redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may
    choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
    warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights
    consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
    obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
    responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only
    if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
    harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
    against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such
    warranty or additional liability.

    \section1 The Public Suffix List

    \e{The Public Suffix List is an initiative of the Mozilla Project, but is
       maintained as a community resource. It is available for use in any
       software, but was originally created to meet the needs of browser
       manufacturers. It allows browsers to, for example:}
    \list
    \li \e{Avoid privacy-damaging "supercookies" being set for high-level
          domain name suffixes}
    \li \e{Highlight the most important part of a domain name in the user
          interface}
    \li \e{Accurately sort history entries by site}
    \endlist

    The public suffix list is used inside Qt to avoid such "supercookies"
    mentioned above being set in the cookie jar supported by Qt (by the
    QNetworkCookieJar class).

    \section1 IAccessible2 IDL Specification

    \e{IAccessible2 is a new accessibility API which complements
       Microsoft's earlier work on MSAA. This API fills critical accessibility
       API gaps in the MSAA offering. IAccessible2 was created out of necessity
       to produce a usable and accessible OpenDocument Format (ODF) based
       office suite for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. IAccessible2 is an
       engineered accessibility interface allowing application developers to
       leverage their investment in MSAA while also providing an Assistive
       Technology (AT) access to rich document applications such as the IBM
       Workplace productivity editors and web browsers such as Firefox. The
       additional functionality includes support for rich text, tables,
       spreadsheets, Web 2.0 applications, and other large mainstream
       applications.}

    \section1 Clucene Core Library

    \e{CLucene is a C++ port of Lucene.  It is a high-performance, full-
    featured text search engine written in C++. CLucene is faster than lucene
    as it is written in C++.}
    -- quoted from \c qttools/src/assistant/3rdparty/clucene/README.


    The CLucene Core Library uses a dual license strategy for the source code.
    These licenses are the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and the Apache
    License (Version 2.0). Users can choose the license they wish to distribute
    their software under. This means that you do not need to abide by *both*
    licenses, but rather than you can choose the license which most suits your
    needs.

    To rephrase this and to make it perfectly clear:
    CLucene is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
            *or*
    the Apache License, Version 2.0

    However, we are an open source project, and we encourage users to use the LGPL
    license and participate fully in the free software community. Dual licensing
    of the CLucene source code provides open and free access to the technology both
    for the GPL community and for other developers or companies that cannot use the
    GPL.

    You can freely modify, extend, and improve the CLucene source code. The only
    question is whether or not you must provide the source code and contribute
    modifications to the community. The GNU and Apache licenses allow different
    ranges of flexibility in this regard, but in the end, regardless of the license
    used, we highly recommend that you submit any bugs, incompatibilities or
    added features.

    Note that this same license does *not* apply to the CLucene Contributions
    package. You should read the COPYING file in that directory or package for
    more information.
