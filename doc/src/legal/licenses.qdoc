    \title Qt Licensing
    \brief Information about licenses and licensing issues.

    Qt is available under different licensing options designed to accommodate
    the needs of our various users:

    \list
      \li Qt licensed under \e commercial licenses is appropriate for
          development of proprietary/commercial software where you do not want
          to share any source code with third parties or otherwise cannot
          comply with the terms of the GNU LGPL version 3.

      \li Qt licensed under the \l{GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)}
          version 3 is appropriate for the development of Qt applications
          provided you can comply with the terms and conditions of the GNU LGPL
          version 3 (or GNU GPL version 3).
      \li Qt components licensed under the \l{Qt Marketplace License Agreement}
          are appropriate for the development of Qt applications commonly with
          Qt software components licensed under the commercial or GNU LGPL
          version 3 (or GNU GPL version 3) terms and conditions.
    \endlist

    Qt contains also \l {Licenses Used in Qt}{third-party code} that is licensed
    under specific open-source licenses from the original authors.

    \note For open-source licensed Qt, some specific parts (modules) are not
    available under the GNU LGPL version 3, but under the
    \l {GNU General Public License (GPL)} instead. See
    the list of \l {gpl-licensed-addons}{Qt modules} for details. For commercial
    licensees, all modules are available under a single, commercial Qt
    license.

    \e {Qt documentation} is available under commercial licenses from
    The Qt Company, and under the terms of the \l{GNU Free
    Documentation License (FDL)} version 1.3, as published by the Free Software
    Foundation.

    \e {Qt examples} are available under commercial licenses from The Qt Company,
    and under a \l{License of Qt examples}{BSD-3-clause} license.

    See \l{http://qt.io/licensing/} for an overview of Qt licensing.

    \section1 Purchasing and Sales Information

    To purchase a Qt license, visit \l{http://www.qt.io/download/}.

    sales; see \l{http://www.qt.io/locations/} for contact details.

    \section1 Licensed Code in Qt

    parts of Qt:

    \keyword Third-Party Licenses Used in Qt
    \title Licenses Used in Qt
    \brief Information about other licenses and third-party code used in Qt.

    Qt contains some code that is not provided under the
    \l{GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)} or the
    \l{Qt Commercial License}, but rather under specific licenses from the
    original authors.

    The Qt Company gratefully acknowledges these and other contributions to Qt.
    We recommend that programs that use Qt also acknowledge these contributions,
    and quote these license statements in an appendix to the documentation.

    \note You only need to comply with (and acknowledge) the licenses of the
          third-party components that you are using with your application.
          Click the name of the component to see the licensing details.

    \b {Third-party Licenses}

    The following table lists parts (modules) of Qt \QtVersion that incorporate
    code licensed under third-party open-source licenses:

    Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
    modification, are permitted.

    There's ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, express or implied.

    (This is a heavily cut-down "BSD license".)

    This differs from Colin Plumb's older public domain implementation in that
    no exactly 32-bit integer data type is required (any 32-bit or wider
    unsigned integer data type will do), there's no compile-time endianness
    configuration, and the function prototypes match OpenSSL's.  No code from
    Colin Plumb's implementation has been reused; this comment merely compares
    the properties of the two independent implementations.

    The primary goals of this implementation are portability and ease of use.
    It is meant to be fast, but not as fast as possible.  Some known
    optimizations are not included to reduce source code size and avoid
    compile-time configuration.
