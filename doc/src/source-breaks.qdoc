\title C++ API changes
\brief Lists the source incompatible API changes in Qt 6.

Qt 6 introduces some source incompatible changes. Here we list some important
ones, but you can find more complete lists in
\c {<Qt 6 Install Dir>/qtbase/dist/changes-6.x.x}.

The following sections list the API changes in each module and provide
recommendations for handling those changes.

\section1 Qt GUI

\list

\li On Windows, ANGLE, a third-party OpenGL ES to Direct 3D translator, is no
longer included in Qt. This means Qt::AA_UseOpenGLES and the environment
variable \c{QT_OPENGL=angle} no longer have any effect. In \l{Qt for Windows -
Requirements}{dynamic OpenGL builds} there is no automatic fallback to ANGLE in
case OpenGL proper fails to initialize. For QWindow or QWidget based
applications using OpenGL directly, for example via QOpenGLWidget, this means
that OpenGL proper is the only option at run time. However, the alternative of
using a pure software OpenGL implementation, such as Mesa llvmpipe that is
shipped with the pre-built Qt packages, is still available. For Qt Quick and Qt
Quick 3D applications, Qt 6 introduces support for Direct 3D 11, Vulkan, and
Metal, in addition to OpenGL. On Windows the default choice is Direct 3D,
therefore the removal of ANGLE is alleviated by having support for graphics
APIs other than OpenGL as well.

\endlist

\section1 Qt Quick

\list

\li QQuickItem's geometryChanged() function was renamed to
\l{QQuickItem::}{geometryChange()}.

\li QQuickWidget is functional only when the scenegraph is rendering with
OpenGL. It will not be functional when using another graphics API, such as
Vulkan or Metal. Applications relying on QQuickWidget should force the usage of
OpenGL by calling
\c{QQuickWindow::setSceneGraphBackend(QSGRendererInterface::OpenGLRhi)} in their
main() function.

\endlist

\section2 Changes to Qt Quick Scenegraph

\list

\li QSGMaterialShader has a changed interface. Implementations should
not rely on OpenGL anymore, and cannot assume that functions, such as
the now-removed updateState(), are called with a QOpenGLContext
current. In the new, data-oriented interface updateState() is replaced
by \l{QSGMaterialShader::updateUniformData()}{updateUniformData()},
\l{QSGMaterialShader::updateSampledImage()}{updateSampledImage()}, and
\l{QSGMaterialShader::updateGraphicsPipelineState()}{updateGraphicsPipelineState()}.
Instead of GLSL shader code provided as strings, shaders are now
expected to be preprocessed by the tools from the Qt Shader Tools
module, such as the \c qsb command line tool, thus ensuring the shader
assets are usable regardless of which graphics API (Vulkan, Metal,
OpenGL, or Direct 3D) is used at run time.

\li QSGEngine has been removed. In the unlikely case of an application
utilizing this class, it is recommended to port to using
QQuickRenderControl instead.

\li QSGAbstractRenderer is no longer public. The usage of this class made
sense only in combination with QSGEngine, and with that class being
removed QSGAbstractRenderer has been moved back to private.

\li The QSGSimpleMaterial convenience class has been
removed. Applications are expected to use the revised, OpenGL-independent
QSGMaterial APIs instead.

\li The QQuickFramebufferObject class is available with an unchanged API, but is
only functional when the scenegraph is rendering with OpenGL. It will not be
functional when using another graphics API, such as Vulkan or
Metal. Applications relying on QQuickFramebufferObject should force the usage of
OpenGL by calling
\c{QQuickWindow::setSceneGraphBackend(QSGRendererInterface::OpenGLRhi)} in their
main() function.

\li Subclasses of QSGImageNode are now required to override new
additional virtuals, such as setAnisotropyLevel() and anisotropyLevel().

\li Subclasses of QSGTexture will likely need to be redesigned. Some of
the OpenGL-specific virtual functions, such as bind() or
updateBindOptions(), are no longer present, while there are new virtuals
that are mandatory to implement, such as
\l{QSGTexture::comparisonKey()}{comparisonKey()}.

\li The existing QQuickWindow::setRenderTarget() overloads, and the
related getters, are removed and replaced by a new function taking a
QQuickRenderTarget. Applications performing redirected rendering in
combination with QQuickRenderControl are now expected to use this new
function to specify the render target in a manner that is not tied to
OpenGL.

\li QQuickRenderControl has a slightly changed API: grab() is now
removed, use QQuickWindow::grabWindow() instead, where applicable. The
initialize() function no longer takes a QOpenGLContext. Applications are
now also required to call QQuickRenderControl::beginFrame() and
QQuickRenderControl::endFrame() as appropriate. When multisampling is
desired, the new function QQuickRenderControl::setSamples() must be
called to indicate the sample count.

\li Applications wishing to perform Qt Quick rendering in combination
with an existing native graphics device or context object must take the
new QQuickWindow::setGraphicsDevice() function into use as
QQuickRenderControl no longer provides the
\c{initialize(QOpenGLContext*)} function.

\li The deprecated QQuickWindow::createTextureFromId() function has
been removed. Use QQuickWindow::createTextureFromNativeObject()
instead.

\li Setting QQuickPaintedItem and Context2D to \c Framebuffer mode has
no effect. It will behave as if the mode was set to the default Image
mode.

\li The QQuickWindow::openglContextCreated() signal has been removed.

\li The QQuickWindow functions setPersistentOpenGLContext and
isPersistentOpenGLContext are renamed, and are now
QQuickWindow::setPersistentGraphics() and QQuickWindow::isPersistentGraphics().

\li The QQuickWindow::openglContext() function has been removed. When the
application has ensured the scene graph is using OpenGL for rendering, it can
query the QOpenGLContext from QSGRendererInterface::getResource().

\li Applications that rely on the QQuickWindow::beforeRendering() or
afterRendering() signals to issue their own set of OpenGL rendering commands
should call QQuickWindow::beginExternalCommands() before, and
QQuickWindow::endExternalCommands() after, the OpenGL calls. This ensures that
state changes made by the application code does not lead to confusion with
regards to the scene graph renderer's own cached state. Note however, that, just
like in Qt 5, changing OpenGL 3.x or 4.x state that is not used by the Qt Quick
renderer can still lead to unexpected issues, so therefore application are
advised to reset any such OpenGL state to the default value before returning
from the slots or lambdas connected to these signals.

\li Applications wishing to integrate their own set of Vulkan, Metal, or
Direct3D rendering commands should be aware of new QQuickWindow signals in
addition to QQuickWindow::beforeRendering() and afterRendering(). The existing
Qt 5 pattern of connecting to just beforeRendering or afterRendering is often
not sufficient anymore on its own, and will likely need to be complemented by
connecting to additional signals, such as
\l{QQuickWindow::beforeRenderPassRecording()}{beforeRenderPassRecording()} or
\l{QQuickWindow::afterRenderPassRecording()}{afterRenderPassRecording()}.

\li resetOpenGLState() has been moved from QQuickWindow to
QQuickFramebufferObject::Renderer. This means that applications subclassing
QQuickFramebufferObject::Renderer can continue to call the function, but they
need to call it on \c this instead of the window. For usages outside of
QQuickFramebufferObject, alternatives have to be implemented. It is recommended
to evaluate if the call is necessary at all, because in many cases it likely is
not. If some OpenGL state needs resetting to the defaults, issue the necessary
OpenGL state change calls directly in the application code.

\li setClearBeforeRendering() and clearBeforeRendering() have been removed from
QQuickWindow. There is no option for skipping the color buffer clearing in Qt
6. Calling setClearBeforeRendering() was often necessary in Qt 5 in combination
with underlays, to prevent Qt Quick from clearing the content rendered into the
color buffer. In Qt 6, there is a more robust approach: connecting to the
beforeRenderPassRecording() signal, that is emitted after clearing, but before
rendering Qt Quick's content.

\endlist

\section1 Changes to Qt OpenGL

\list

\li Classes with the QGL prefix, such as QGLWidget have been removed.

\li The helper and convenience classes with the the QOpenGL prefix,
including QPainter's OpenGL paint engine, have been moved from Qt
Gui to the Qt OpenGL module. Applications using these classes should
add \c{QT += opengl} to their project files.

\li QOpenGLWidget has been moved to its own \c openglwidgets
module. Applications relying on QOpenGLWidget should add \c{QT +=
openglwidgets} to their project file.

\li QOpenGLContext::versionFunctions() is replaced by
QOpenGLVersionFunctionsFactory::get().

\endlist
