    \title Get and Install Qt with Qt Online Installer
    \brief Downloading and installing the Qt modules and tools that you need.

    The Qt Online Installer gives you the choice of installing only the modules
    and tools you need to develop on a particular desktop platform and to run
    your applications on one or several desktop platforms, mobile or embedded
    devices, or MCUs.

    If instead you prefer to build Qt from sources, please see \l{Building Qt
    Sources}.

    \section1 1. Create a Qt Account

    To begin, create a \l{Qt Account}. This account gives you access to a web
    portal where you can manage your licenses, as well as access to the forums
    and wikis. Also, make sure you read the \l{Qt Licensing} page regarding your
    chosen license.

    \section1 2. Download the Installer

    Go to your Qt account's download page. By selecting the appropriate unified
    Qt online installer for your OS, you can install commercial or open source
    versions of Qt, development tools, and other components. The online
    installer asks for your Qt account credentials. The installer retrieves the
    license attached to the account from a server and provides a list of
    available components corresponding to the license.

    \section1 3. Install Qt

    To complete the installation, select the components that you want to install
    and follow the instructions of the installation program.

    You must select at least one Qt version for one platform that you want to
    run your applications on. For example, if you have installed Microsoft
    Visual Studio 2022 on 64-bit Windows, you could
    select \e {MSVC 2022 64-bit} under the Qt version you want to develop with.

    However, the easiest way to install Qt for desktop development is to select
    the default installation for desktop development. You can install additional
    modules later.

    If you also want to run your applications on Android devices, for example,
    you should select the default installation for mobile development.

    The following table contains examples of which components to install
    depending on the platforms where you want to run your applications.

    \table
    \header
        \li To Develop For
        \li Choose
    \row
        \li Desktop
        \li Default installation for \e {desktop development}.

            If you want to use other than the default toolchain, such as
            MSVC on Windows, select \e {Custom installation}. Then
            select the Qt for the toolchain you want to use.
    \row
        \li Mobile Devices
        \li Default installation for \e {mobile development}.

            If you only want to develop for a particular platform, select
            \e {Custom installation}. Then select the Qt for the mobile
            device platform that you want to run the applications on. For
            example, \l{Qt for Android} or \l{Qt for iOS}.
    \row
        \li Embedded Devices
        \li Custom installation, with the necessary Qt modules and toolchains
            from the \l{Boot to Qt} section, depending on the types
            of devices that you want to run applications on.
    \row
        \li Android Automotive
        \li Custom installation, with \l{Qt for Android Automotive}.
    \row
        \li Automation
        \li Custom installation, with the necessary Qt modules and toolchains
            from the \l{Qt for Automation}{Qt for Automation/Qt M2M Protocols}
            section, depending on the types of devices that you want to run
            applications on.
    \row
        \li MCUs
        \li Custom installation, with \l{Qt for MCUs}.
    \endtable

    To check the platform requirements, see \l{Supported Platforms}.

    The following YouTube video gives a complete walk-through of the
    installation process:

    \section2 Updating or Removing Components

    Once Qt is installed, you can use the \e{Maintenance Tool} under
    \e{<install_dir>} to add components, update, or remove installed
    components.

    \section2 Getting Help

    Evaluation and open source users can get help on the
    \l {https://forum.qt.io/}{Qt forum}. See also the
    \l {https://wiki.qt.io/Forum_Help}{Help on using the Forum} wiki page.

    Non-commercial users can get limited help with the installation process
    through \l {https://account.qt.io/support}{Qt support}.

    The primary support channel for commercial customers is their
    \l {https://account.qt.io/support}{Qt Account}.

    \section1 4. Create Applications

    After the installation, \l{Qt Creator Manual}{Qt Creator} opens. You can
    use the project wizard templates to start creating applications that run
    on your chosen platform.

    If you want to design Qt Quick UIs, open \l{Qt Design Studio Manual}
    {Qt Design Studio} and use the project wizard templates there.
