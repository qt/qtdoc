    \title All Modules
    \brief A list of all modules in Qt 6.

    \ingroup classlists

    \brief Qt consists of essential modules, add-on modules, and tools.

    \section1 Qt Essentials

    Qt Essentials define the foundation of Qt on all platforms. They are
    available on all supported development platforms and on the tested target
    platforms. Except the testing modules, which will remain source compatible,
    these modules will remain source and binary compatible throughout Qt 6.

    Essential modules are general and useful for a majority of Qt applications.
    A module that is used for a special purpose is considered an add-on module
    even if it is available on all supported platforms.

//! [essentials]

    \note The binary compatibility guarantee does not apply to \l {Qt Test} and
          \l {Qt Quick Test} modules. However, they will remain source compatible.

    \section1 Qt Add-Ons

    \e{Qt Add-On} modules bring additional value for specific purposes. These
    modules may only be available on some development platform. Many add-on
    modules are either feature-complete and exist for backwards compatibility,
    or are only applicable to certain platforms. Each add-on module specifies
    its compatibility promise separately.

    The Qt installers include the option of downloading the add-ons. For more
    information, visit the \l{Getting Started with Qt} page.

    \section1 Qt Extension Modules

    Qt Extension Modules bring additional functionality to Qt. They may be part
    of a given Qt release, but can deviate from the other Qt modules in terms of
    release schedule, platform support, the binaries Qt provides, commercial
    support, or compatibility promises. You can find specific details in the
    module documentation for each Extension Module.
