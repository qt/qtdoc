    Qt for Android enables you to develop Qt applications for Android devices,
    and supports a wide range of features and use-cases.

    To start your Qt for Android application, download and install Qt for Android
    and use the Qt Creator IDE, follow the instructions on the
    \l{Getting Started with Qt for Android} page.

    If you have an existing Android application try Qt's \l{\QtTAS}{plugin}
    for Google's Android Studio. Find it on the IntelliJ marketplace to download.
    The plugin allows you use the \l{Qt Quick View Android Class} to add
    Qt Quick content to your Android app as a \l {Android: View}{View}.

     To build Qt from source, see
     \l{Qt for Android - Building from Source}{Building from Source}.

    To learn the basics of getting started with Qt for Android, take the
    \l {https://www.qt.io/academy/course-catalog#getting-started-with-qt-for-android-}
    {Getting Started with Qt for Android} course in Qt Academy.

    The rest of this page has more detailed getting started information.

    To download and install Qt for Android, follow the instructions on the
    \l{Getting Started with Qt} page.

    \section1 Android Development Prerequisites

    In order to develop with \l{Qt for Android}, you will need the following
    prerequisites:

    \list
        \li \l {Java Development Kit (JDK)}
        \li \l {Android: Android command line tools}{Android Command Line Tools}
            which includes:
            \list
                \li \l{Android: The Android NDK}{Android NDK}: for building C++ code.
                \li \l{Android: Android SDK Platforms}{Android SDK Platform} and
                    \l{Android: Android SDK Build Tools}{Android SDK Build Tools}: for building
                    Android apps for specific API version.
                \li \l{Android: Android SDK Platform Tools}{Android SDK Platform Tools}:
                    for deploying and managing Android dependencies.
            \endlist
    \endlist

    The easiest way to manage these dependencies is by using Qt Creator's built in
    Android development setup. For more information, see
    \l{Qt Creator: Specifying Android Device Settings}.

    \section2 Manually Installing the Prerequisites

    If you prefer to manually install the prerequisites please follow
    these next steps.

    \section3 Java Development Kit (JDK)

    Qt for Android development requires JDK \JdkVer or above, provided by any of the
    following supported distributions:

    \list
        \li \l{Adoptium}
        \li \l{OpenJDK}
        \li \l{Java SE Development Kit}
    \endlist

    Install your preferred JDK. If your installer doesn't set the
    \c JAVA_HOME environment variable that points to the location of
    the installed JDK, you can set it manually. For example on Linux:

    \badcode \JdkVer
    sudo apt-get install openjdk-\1-jdk
    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-\1-openjdk-amd64
    \endcode

    Or on \macOS:

    \badcode \JdkVer
    brew install openjdk@\1
    sudo ln -sfn "$(brew --prefix openjdk@\1)/libexec/openjdk.jdk" \
        "/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-\1.jdk"
    export JAVA_HOME="$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v \1)"
    \endcode

    \section3 Android SDK Command Line Tools

    Download the latest version of the
    \l{Android: Android command line tools}{Android SDK Command Line Tools}
    for your operating system and extract it to the appropriate path as stated below.

//! [Android SDK Paths]
    The Android SDK is commonly installed by Qt Creator or Android Studio
    in the following locations:
    \list
        \li Linux: ~/Android/Sdk/
        \li \macos: ~/Library/Android/sdk/
        \li Windows: C:\\Users\\<USER>\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk\\
    \endlist
//! [Android SDK Paths]

    Or use your OS's package manager, for example for \macOS:

    \badcode
    brew install android-commandlinetool
    \endcode

    \section3 Android SDK Mandatory Packages

    Make sure to install the SDK Platform, Platform Tools, and Build Tools.
    For Qt \QtVer, use:

    \badcode \AndroidPlatformVer \AndroidBuildToolsVer
    sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-\1" "build-tools;\2"
    \endcode

    \section3 Android NDK

    Qt \QtVer uses NDK \NdkFullVer, you can install it by running:

    \badcode \NdkFullVer
    sdkmanager "ndk;\1"
    \endcode

    For example for \macOS:

    \section3 Emulator

    If you wish to use the \l{Android: Android Emulator}{Android Emulator},
    you can install it by running:

    \badcode
    sdkmanager "emulator" "patcher;v4"
    \endcode

    \section3 Platform Specific Configurations

    \section4 Windows

    The default USB driver on Windows does not allow debugging using
    Android Debug Bridge (ADB) tool. You must install the additional USB driver
    provided by the \e extras Android SDK package. Install it by running the following:

    \badcode
    sdkmanager.bat "extras;google;usb_driver"
    \endcode

    \section4 Linux

    The following dependencies are needed for using tools such as \c adb or \c gdb which
    can be used by Qt Creator:

    \badcode
    sudo apt-get install libstdc++6 libncurses5
    \endcode

    \target emulator dependencies
    To run the Android emulator, the following dependencies are also necessary:

    \section3 Testing the Setup

    Now you can test your development setup by running the examples shipped with the
    Qt installation. For more information, see
    \l{Qt Examples And Tutorials#Mobile}{Mobile Examples}.

    To develop a simple application from scratch, see
    \l {Qt Creator: Creating a Mobile Application}.

/*!
    \page android-supported-versions-selection-guidelines.html
    \title Qt for Android Supported Versions Selection Guidelines
    \brief Provides information about supported Android versions under a Qt release.

    To keep the supported versions to a level that’s maintainable
    by Qt, especially for LTS releases which are expected to live for a period of
    3 years, Qt for Android has guidelines for selecting the supported
    versions for a given Qt release. This makes the selection clear and
    transparent, and help shape proper expectations of support for each Qt for
    Android release.

    \section1 Minimum Supported Version

    The guidelines for selecting the minimum supported version are:

    \list
        \li Evaluate the minimum version once a year for the fall release of Qt,
            which would also cover LTS releases.
        \li Target at least 90% of the cumulative usage in the market as listed
            on \l {https://apilevels.com}{apilevels.com} at the time of the
            platform freeze deadline of a given fall release.
        \li The selection is done 1 month before the platform freeze, at which
            time we check what versions would fit the 90% range, and decide
            whether to select a more recent minimum version or not and to what
            new minimum version.
        \li The changes are communicated to the Qt development mailing list,
            and reflected in the release change log and Qt for Android documentation.
        \li In exceptional cases where a change is needed to a version that doesn’t
            respect the criteria above, it will be announced at the time of the
            platform freeze deadline along with reasons for the decision.
    \endlist

    The minimum version changes would be reflected in our CI test runs, and in
    the build system (i.e. CMake and androiddeployqt), thus the released libraries
    would require said minimum version to run. To target older versions a Qt
    rebuild with appropriate build system changes would be needed. Even if such
    builds might work for older versions, note that they would fall outside
    of Qt official support scope. Although, the official Qt for Android libraries
    might or might not work for builds targeting older versions than the minimum
    for the release.

    \section1 Maximum Supported Version

    In a spring Qt release, we aim to support an Android version which was
    released by Google in the fall of the year before. This becomes the new
    maximum supported version by Qt.

    \section1 Target Devices used in Automated Testing
