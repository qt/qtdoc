    \title Supported Platforms
    \brief The platforms supported by Qt.

    The following platforms are supported in Qt \qtver. For information
    about prior Qt releases, please consult the relevant version in the
    \l {http://doc.qt.io/archives/}{Qt Documentation Archives}.

    Supported platforms are actively maintained, subjected to testing, and
    bugs discovered in these platforms are prioritized for correction.
    Significant errors discovered in testing can impact release dates.

    The Qt Company offers commercial support for all officially supported
    platforms and configurations.

    \note Some of the platforms are only supported for certain types of
    commercial licenses. For details, please refer to
    \l{Qt Support Terms and Conditions} and your commercial license agreement.

    Configurations not listed below are not officially supported by the Qt Project.
    However, Qt may still run on unsupported platforms and configurations. The Qt
    Company, Qt partners, open source developers, and community users are able to
    provide assistance in this situation.

    \note Support for specific configurations or operating system versions may
          end before the support for Qt \qtver does. A subsequent patch release
          of Qt \qtver may drop support for a configuration or replace it with
          a currently-supported version.

    \section1 Availability of Packages

    You can download the Qt installers and source packages from the \l Downloads page.
    For more information, visit the \l{Getting Started with Qt} page.

    \note All the supported configurations are not provided as binary packages
    in \QOI. However, the intention is to provide the most widely-used
    configurations for the developer's convenience.

    \note Linux binary packages are linked against glibc 2.28. If you are using
    a glibc version older than that you need to build Qt from sources or upgrade
    glibc to 2.28 or newer.

    \section2 Exceptions
    Individual modules might be available only on some platforms, or they might
    not support all configurations. For example, as Qt \WebEngine has Chromium
    as a third-party dependency, platform or configuration limitations upstream
    also apply to Qt \WebEngine.

    The documentation for each module contains detailed information about any
    exceptions the module has from the general platform and configuration
    support as described on this page.

    \section1 Deployment of Qt Applications

    The deployment procedure for each platform is different and they are
    covered in greater detail in their platform pages. Meanwhile, there is a
    deployment article for summarizing the deployment procedure in general.
