    \title What's New in Qt 6.8
    \ingroup whatsnewqt6
    \brief Lists the new features in Qt 6.8.

    \section1 New and Restored Modules in Qt 6.8
    Qt 6.8 adds the following modules and tools:

    \list
        \li The \l{svgtoqml} tool, used to generate QML code from SVG
            documents, is now out of tech preview. The tool supports a static
            subset of the \c{SVG Tiny 1.2} profile.
        \li The \l{Qt Graphs}, \l{Qt HTTP Server}, \l{Qt Protobuf}, and \l{Qt GRPC}
            modules are
            all promoted out of tech preview state.
        \li Added \l{Qt Quick Vector Image QML Types}{Qt Quick Vector Image} module for
            displaying SVG documents as scalable vector graphics in a Qt Quick scene.
    \endlist

    \section1 Removed Modules in Qt 6.8
    The following module is deprecated. We strongly advise against using it
    in new code.

    \section2 Qt 3D Module
    The \l [Qt3D]{Qt 3D} module is deprecated. Qt 3D remains part of the
    licensed software, and remains part of the Qt Project. The module continues
    to be integrated with other modules for future releases. Critical bugs and
    security vulnerabilities will be addressed by the module maintainers at
    KDAB. Regarding new features and functionality, users should contact KDAB
    by emailing info@kdab.com.

    \section1 New Features in Qt 6.8

    \section2 Qt Core Module
    \list
        \li QChronoTimer is a replacement for QTimer using std::chrono
            durations throughout.
        \li QTimer::id() returns a Qt::TimerId, introduced and accepted in
            place of int timer IDs in new overloads of various methods that
            take one.
        \li More support for std::chrono durations to replace integral
            nanosecond parameters in QAbstractEventDispatcher.
        \li QString, QByteArray, and QList gain resizeForOverwrite().
        \li QString, QByteArray gain slice() equivalent to
            \c{*this = sliced()}.
        \li QString, QByteArray, QList, QVarLengthArray gain max_size() for
            compatibility with the Standard Template Library (STL).
        \li QList supports construction with uninitialized entries to a
            specified size, where the content-type permits.
        \li QVarLengthArray::PreallocatedSize tells you the Prealloc parameter.
        \li \l QLatin1StringMatcher::indexIn() can now take a QStringView.
        \li QCollatorSortKey now supports move-construction.
        \li QStringEncoder and QStringDecoder can now take the encoding name as
            a QString.
        \li QThread gains \l{QThread::}{isMainThread()}, \l{QThread::}{isCurrentThread()}.
        \li QThreadPool::waitForDone() now accepts a QDeadlineTimer in place of
            int milliseconds.
        \li QDirListing provides stl-style iteration over directory entries.
        \li QVersionNumber can now be constructed from a QSpan; it can also be
            iterated over.
        \li qHash() now accepts quint128 and qint128.
        \li QMap::qHash() tells you a key's hash value.
        \li QHash can now hash different types from its key, if they are marked
            as having the equivalent hash result for equivalent values
            (C++20 only). This works for QString/QStringView and
            QByteArray/QByteArrayView pairs. On all systems except on ARM
            processors, the QLatin1StringView also participates in the QString
            and QStringView hashing.
        \li QPointF, QLineF, QRectF, and QMarginsF now support fuzzy comparison
            and null-checks.
        \li Define \e QT_ENABLE_STRICT_MODE_UP_TO to opt out of various APIs,
            documented by which version it cuts them out at.
        \li Define \e QT_NO_QASCONST to disable qAsConst().
        \li Define \e {QT_(NO_)USE_NODISCARD_FILE_OPEN} to control
            \c {[[nodiscard]]} on \c{open()} methods of I/O classes.
        \li QLibraryInfo::paths() returns all relevant paths.
        \li QCryptographicHash and QMessageAuthenticationCode gain
            \l{QCryptographicHash::}{hashInto()} to compute the hash of data
            into a provided buffer.
        \li More QtCore types with \c {operator<()} now also support
            \c {operator<=>()} when compiled with C++20
            (and \c {compareThreeWay()} even for C++17). These types now
            consistently support all six relational operators (as hidden
            friends) and the reverse of each mixed-type comparison they
            supported. At Qt 6.8, this applies to:
            \list
            \li \l qfloat16
            \li \l QAnyStringView
            \li \l QByteArray
            \li \l QByteArrayView
            \li \l QCborArray
            \li \l QCborMap
            \li \l QCborValue
            \li \l QChar
            \li \l QDate
            \li \l QDateTime
            \li \l QDeadlineTimer
            \li \l QElapsedTimer
            \li \l QLatin1Char
            \li \l QLatin1StringView
            \li \l QModelIndex
            \li \l QOperatingSystemVersion
            \li \l QPersistentModelIndex
            \li \l QString
            \li \l QStringView
            \li \l QTime
            \li \l QTypeRevision
            \li \l QUrl
            \li \l QUtf8StringView
            \li \l QUuid
            \li \l QVersionNumber
        \endlist
        \li The QtJniTypes namespace, with macros to declare Java types with
            their JNI signature, is promoted out of technology preview and
            documented.
        \li The variadic template versions of QJniObject and QJniEnvironment
            APIs are no longer preliminary and fully documented.
        \li The new QJniArray template class makes it easy to work with Java
            arrays from C++ code.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Graphs Module
    \list
        \li \l{Qt Graphs} is promoted out of tech preview.
        \li The module is split into two submodules, \l{Qt Graphs} and
            \l{Qt Graphs Widgets}, to remove the requirement for including widgets
            into pure QML applications.
        \li Unified theming for 2D and 3D graphs.
            See \l {QtGraphs::GraphsTheme}{GraphsTheme}.
        \li See migration guides \l {Qt Graphs Migration from Qt Charts}
        {from Qt Charts} and \l {Qt Graphs Migration from Qt DataVisualization}
        {from Qt DataVisualization}.
    \endlist
    \section3 Qt Graphs3D
    \list
        \li Added transparency support for \l {QtGraphs::Bars3D}{Bars3D}

            See \l {QtGraphs::GraphsItem3D::labelMargin}{GraphsItem3D.labelMargin}.
        \li Added support for rendering the grid with a shader and changing the gridline width.
            See \l {QtGraphs::GraphsItem3D::gridLineType}{GraphsItem3D.gridLineType}
            and \l {QtGraphs::GraphsTheme::GraphsLine::mainWidth}{GraphsTheme.GraphsLine.mainWidth}.
    \endlist
    \section3 Qt Graphs2D
    \list
        \li Added support for \l {QtGraphs::AreaSeries}{AreaSeries}.

            See \l {QtGraphs::BarSeries::barsType}{BarSeries.barsType}.
        \li Added support for bar graph labels.
            See \l {QtGraphs::BarSeries::labelsVisible}{BarSeries.labelsVisible}.
        \li Added model mappers support for different series.
            See \l {QtGraphs::XYModelMapper}{XYModelMapper},
            \l {QtGraphs::BarModelMapper}{BarModelMapper} and
            \l {QtGraphs::PieModelMapper}{PieModelMapper}.
        \li Added \l {QtGraphs::LegendData}{LegendData} support for all series.
        \li Added support for dynamic splineseries.
        \li Added support for axis titles.
            See \l {QtGraphs::AbstractAxis::titleText}{AbstractAxis.titleText}.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt GRPC Module
    \list
        \li \l{Qt GRPC} is promoted out of tech preview.
        \li Added streaming support to the GrpcQuick module.
        \li Removed QGrpcInterceptor, QGrpcInterceptorManager and
            QGrpcInterceptorContinuation.
        \li Added the \c {writesDone()} method to QGrpcClientStream and
            QGrpcBidirStream to half-close a stream from the client side.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt GUI Module
    \list
        \li QStyleHints::colorScheme now has a setter function that allows
            applications to try to override the system setting with an explicit
            Dark or Light scheme.
        \li Added QFont::ContextFontMerging, which can be used to enable a new
            font merging algorithm that takes the full string into account when
            selecting fallback fonts. This may come at some more cost, but in
            certain cases, it will give better results.
        \li Added QFont::PreferTypoLineMetrics style strategy, which can be set
            to always prefer the typographical line metrics in OpenType fonts,
            even if the font does not manually set the \e USE_TYPO_METRICS flag.
        \li Added QDesktopServices custom and \e https URL scheme support for
            \macos, similar to what iOS has.
        \li QImage::Format_CMYK8888 32bit CMYK image format has been added.
        \li QColorSpace support for ICC A2B color spaces processing has been
            added, along with explicit support for grayscale and CMYK color
            spaces.
        \li Added support for QColorSpace::Bt2020, QColorSpace::Bt2100Pq, and
            QColorSpace::Bt2100Hlg HDR color spaces.
        \li QColorSpace::transformModel() returns the underlying processing
            model.
        \li QColorSpace::colorModel() returns which color model the color space
            is made for.
        \li QImage::colorTransformed() and QImage::applyColorTransform()
            variants with three arguments has been added to support converting
            both image format and color space at the same time.
        \li QStyleHints::contextMenuTrigger is a writable property that allows
            applications to control whether context menus should be opened via
            button press or release.
        \li Qt Accessibility interfaces now can support reporting of
            \l{QAccessible::Attribute}{attributes} as key/value pairs to
            clients.
        \li QAccessibleAnnouncementEvent can be raised by applications to
            request the announcement of a message by assistive technologies.
        \li QPageLayout::setMargins now can take an optional
            \l {QPageLayout::}{OutOfBoundsPolicy} parameter to indicate whether
            margins that are out of bounds should be rejected or clamped.
        \li QPdfWriter gained CMYK support for pens/fills.
        \li QFontDatabase gained
            \l {QFontDatabase::}{addApplicationFallbackFontFamily} to specify
            the override default fallback font families for specific scripts.
        \li Completed multiview rendering support in QRhi. Multiview is now
            also supported with Vulkan 1.1 implementations, instead of
            requiring Vulkan 1.2. This is relevant in particular for
            Android-based devices such as the Meta Quest 3.
        \li Introduced QRhi support for automatically resolving multisample
            depth (depth/stencil) rendering into a non-multisample depth
            (depth/stencil) texture, on platforms and APIs where this can be
            supported. See
            \l{QRhiTextureRenderTargetDescription::setDepthResolveTexture()}
            and \l {QRhi::ResolveDepthStencil} for details.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Multimedia Module
    \list
        \li Added the classes \l QVideoFrameInput and \l QAudioBufferInput,
            which can send custom media data to \l QMediaRecorder through
            \l QMediaCaptureSession.
        \li Added the class \l QAudioBufferOutput, which can receive
            decoded audio data from \l QMediaPlayer.
        \li Added the class \l QAbstractVideoBuffer, allowing the creation
            of \l QVideoFrame instances with custom video data.
        \li \l QMediaRecorder can write the media output to \l QIODevice.
        \li Added support of \l QScreenCapture on Linux using the Wayland
            compositor, which supports the ScreenCast service via XDG Desktop
            Portal.
        \li The FFmpeg library is dynamically linked to the FFmpeg plugin, and
            the utilized shared FFmpeg modules are shipped with Qt Multimedia.
        \li Added support for the FFmpeg media backend on iOS.
        \li Bumped the minimum required GStreamer version to 1.20.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Network Module
    \list
        \li QNetworkAccessManager gained support for sending HTTP requests over
            a local socket using the \e{unix+http:} or \e{local+http:} scheme.
        \li QDnsLookup now supports sending DNS over TLS and can inform whether
            the DNS server has performed verification on data authenticity.
        \li QDnsLookup gained support for TLS Association records.
        \li \l {QNetworkCacheMetaData::headers}{QNetworkCacheMetaData},
            \l {QNetworkProxy::headers}{QNetworkProxy},
            \l {QNetworkRequest::headers}{QNetworkRequest}, and
            \l {QNetworkReply::headers}{QNetworkReply} can now get and set
            headers.
        \li QNetworkRequestFactory allows setting the
            \l {QNetworkRequestFactory::}{priority} as well as
            \l {QNetworkRequest::Attribute}{attributes} for future requests.
        \li Added classes QFormDataPartBuilder and QFormDataBuilder to ease the
            creation of QHttpMultipart messages.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Network Auth Module
    \list
        \li Added QOAuthUriSchemeReplyHandler class, which handles
            private/custom and https URI scheme redirects (supported
            platforms: iOS, Android, and \macos).
        \li Added Proof of Key Code Exchange (PKCE) support to the
            QOAuth2AuthorizationCodeFlow class. PKCE is a recommended
            security measure to mitigate authorization code interception
            attacks.
        \li Following input from several users we went back and addressed
            many issues with the aim to generally improve qnetworkauth.
            This includes several bug fixes, improvements, deprecations,
            documentation additions, and also an overview documentation
            to help with getting started.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Positioning Module
    \list
        \li The Qt Positioning Android backend can now provide altitude in
            \l {Qt Positioning Android plugin}{MSL format} on Android 14 and
            later.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Protobuf Module
    \list
        \li The \l{Qt Protobuf} module is promoted out of tech preview.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt QML Module
    \list
        \li Added new features to QML Language Server: semantic highlighting,
            more JavaScript language support, snippet support for Quick types,
            documentation hints, QML file renaming, \c{.qmllint.ini} warning
            configuration support
        \li Two new \l{qt_policy}{CMake Policies} affecting the behavior of
            \l qt_add_qml_module have been added: \l{QTP0004} eases the use
            of QML modules when nested folder structures are used. \l{QTP0005}
            allows the usage of targets when specifying imports and
            dependencies.
    \endlist
    \section3 Qt Quick Compiler
    \list
        \li The Qml Script Compiler now records statistics about Qml to Cpp
            compilation. This information can be displayed by running the
            all_aotstats target on the project.
    \endlist


    \section2 Qt Quick Module
    \list
        \li Added font.contextFontMerging, which can be used to enable a new
            font merging algorithm that takes the full text into account when
            selecting fallback fonts. This may come at some more cost, but in
            certain cases it will give better results.
        \li Added font.preferTypoLineMetrics property, which can be set to
            always prefer the typographical line metrics in OpenType fonts,
            even if the font does not manually set the \e USE_TYPO_METRICS
            flag.
        \li Added the \l {QtQuick::Image::}{retainWhileLoading} property to
            \l {QtQuick::}{Image} and \l {QtQuick::}{BorderImage}. When set to
            \c true on images that load asynchronously, the current image data
            will be retained until the new image is fully loaded. This can
            avoid flickering.
        \li Added PlanarTransform, a utility object providing simple functions
            for specifying 2D transformation matrices.
        \li Added PathRectangle, an optionally rounded rectangle path for
            \l Shape and \l PathView.
        \li Added the \l {QtQuick::Drag::imageSourceSize}{Drag.imageSourceSize}
            property to control the size of the image representing the data
            being dragged.
        \li Added \l {QQuickRenderTarget::depthTexture} as a way to set a
            custom depth texture.
        \li Added \l {QQuickRenderTarget::Flag} enumerator to allow specifying
            a view format when constructing through the named constructors.
        \li \l {QtQuick::}{TableView} now has support for programmatically and
            interactively moving \l {QtQuick::TableView::moveColumn}{columns}
            and \l {QtQuick::TableView::moveRow}{rows}.
        \li All standard Qt Quick items and materials are made compatible with
            \l {Multiview Rendering}. This is utilized transparently to the
            applications when 2D content is embedded into an Qt Quick 3D XR
            scene and multiview rendering is enabled. Multiview rendering can
            improve rendering performance and decrease power consumption of
            AR/VR devices.
        \li Creating multiview-compatible custom materials
            (QSGMaterial, QSGMaterialShader) is made possible via
            \l {QSGMaterial::viewCount()}.
        \li Added support for directing Qt Quick rendering into a 2D texture
            array with \l {Multiview Rendering} in QQuickRenderTarget. This is
            realized via new overloads of functions such as
            \l{QQuickRenderTarget::fromVulkanImage()}, and forms the foundation
            of multiview rendering support for XR applications built with
            \l {Qt Quick 3D}.
        \li Added support for automatically performing
            \l{QQuickRenderTarget::Flag}{multisample resolve} at the end of a
            render pass in QQuickRenderTarget. Previously multisample rendering
            of redirected Qt Quick scenes was only possible by targeting
            multisample textures, leaving resolving up to the application or
            its shaders. When enabled, Qt Quick will now automatically create
            intermediate, multisample textures for use as a color buffer,
            performing the resolve into the application-provided
            non-multisample texture automatically. This allows making Qt Quick
            rendering target textures provided by an external engine,
            framework, or API (e.g., OpenXR) that only provides and consumes
            non-multisample textures.
        \li Added support for
            \l{QQuickRenderTarget::setDepthTexture()}{setting a depth texture}
            in QQuickRenderTarget. This allows specifying the application's own
            texture (or texture array, when using multiview rendering) where
            depth data is written, instead of using Qt's own intermediate
            buffers. Useful in particular when depth data must be written to a
            depth texture provided by an external engine, framework, or API
            (e.g., OpenXR).
        \li Added support for specifying a texture view format in
            QQuickRenderTarget. This is specified via the \c viewFormat
            argument in the new overloads for
            \l{QQuickRenderTarget::fromVulkanImage()} and similar. This feature
            is provided specifically to allow dropping or adding the sRGB
            qualifier from or to the texture format, and is useful when having
            to work with textures provided by an external engine, framework, or
            XR compositor, where control over the texture format is not
            available, yet the 3D APIs' implicit linear->sRGB conversion on
            shader writes is not acceptable (e.g., because the Qt Quick 3D
            material pipeline already performs the same operation).
       \li QQuickRenderTarget's internal management of intermediate buffers for
           depth/stencil and multisample color data has been redesigned.
           Calling \l {QQuickWindow::setRenderTarget()} no longer invalidates
           all internal temporary buffers, but rather attempts reuse as long as
           the size, format, and other parameters match. This is expected to
           lead to performance improvements in applications and libraries that
           have to pass in a different native texture to the QQuickWindow on
           every frame (e.g, because the texture comes from a buffer pool
           maintained by an external engine, framework, or XR compositor).
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Quick Controls Module
    \list
        \li Added \l {FluentWinUI3 Style}, a modern native-looking style
            designed for platforms running Windows 11 and above.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Quick Shapes Module
    \list
        \li Added the \e {ShapePath.fillItem} property. This can be used to
            take any texture provider item (such as layered items and images)
            and use them as fill for the shape.
        \li Added the \e {ShapePath.fillTransform} property, which can be used
            to set an arbitrary transform on the shape's fill, whether it is an
            item or a gradient.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Quick 3D Module
    \list
        \li Technology Preview of XR support for Qt Quick 3D
            \list
                \li Support for Head Mounted Displays (HMD) using OpenXR such
                    as the Meta Quest 2 and 3.
                \li Support for Apple Vision Pro.
                \li Multi-view rendering (render both eyes in a single pass).
                \li Spatial input support via hand tracking or controllers.
                \li Support for spatial anchors.
            \endlist
        \li Improved Shadow Rendering
            \list
                \li Overall quality improvements.
                \li Enhanced shadow debug tooling.
                \li Cascading Shadow Maps.
                \li Percentage-closer filtering (PCF) soft shadows.
            \endlist
        \li \l PrincipledMaterial Enhancements
            \list
                \li Additional parameters for adjusting Fresnel.
                \li Support for property masking based on the vertex color
                    attribute.
            \endlist
        \li \l CustomMaterial: expose remaining properties from
            \l PrincipledMaterial.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Quick VectorImage Module
    \list
        \li Introduced the VectorImage: A component which can be used to render
            vector graphics directly Qt Quick with hardware acceleration and no
            pre-rasterization. It currently supports the SVG format (a static
            subset of the \c{SVG Tiny 1.2} profile.)
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Shader Tools Module
    \list
        \li Completed support for shaders compatible with multiview rendering.
            Added the \c MULTIVIEW keyword to the
            \l {Qt Shader Tools Build System Integration}.
        \li Added depfile support for shaders processed at build time via
            \l{Qt Shader Tools Build System Integration}{qt_add_shaders()}.
            Touching a file included via the \c{#include} directive in a shader
            will now trigger a recompilation of that shader file when building
            the project the next time.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Sql Module
    \list
        \li QSqlDatabase, QSqlQuery, and QSqlDriver gained
            \l {QSqlDatabase::}{numericalPrecisionPolicy}.
        \li QSqlDatabase got a new function moveToThread() to change the thread
            affinity of the database connection.
        \li The PostgreSQL and MySQL/MariaDB drivers now correctly handle
            dates/times when the server is in a different timezone than the
            client.
        \li All logging is now done through categorized loggers, \e {qt.sql},
            to improve debugging.
        \li \l {QSqlField::defaultValue}, \l {QSqlField::}{value},
            \l {QSqlField::}{readOnly}, \l {QSqlField::}{requiredStatus},
            \l {QSqlField::}{length}, \l {QSqlField::}{precision},
            \l {QSqlField::}{generated}, \l {QSqlField::}{autoValue},
            and \l {QSqlField::}{tableName} are now properties.
        \li \l {QSqlIndex::name} and \l {QSqlIndex::}{cursorName},
            \l {QSqlQuery::forwardOnly}, and
            \l {QSqlQuery::}{positionalBindingEnabled} are now properties.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Test Module
    \list
        \li Added \l{QTEST_THROW_ON_FAIL} and \l{QTEST_THROW_ON_SKIP} C++
            macros and \l{Qt Test Environment Variables}{environment variables}
            that, when defined, change how QCOMPARE()/QVERIFY()/QSKIP() etc
            exit the test function on failure. Instead of a return, exiting
            only the immediately-surrounding function, they throw a special
            exception instead, thereby exiting from sub-functions of the test
            function, all the way to QtTestLib.
        \li The \e {QTRY_*_WITH_TIMEOUT} macros now also accept chrono literals
            (was: \c int milliseconds).
        \li QTest::failOnWarning() now has a no-parameter overload to support
            the common case of fail-on-any-warning, without needing to
            construct a match-everything regular expression.
        \li \l QSignalSpy no longer inherits from \l QObject. If your code uses
            the fact that QSignalSpy is-a QObject, you need to redesign around
            this now.
        \li The QSignalSpy::signal() method no longer necessarily returns an
            empty byte array when the connection failed. Use the existing
            \l{QSignalSpy::}{isValid()} method to determine whether a given
            QSignalSpy object listens to a valid signal on a valid object.
        \li The QCOMPARE_xx macros can now only find QTest::toString()
            expansions that are either found via Argument Dependent Lookup on
            the type in question or are an instantiation of the
            QTest::toString<T>() template. This matches the behavior of the
            \l QCOMPARE() macro.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt WebEngine Module
    \list
        \li QWebEngineFrame added for frame specific API, such as running
            javascript on specific frames, or printing specific frames.
        \li QWebEngineClientHints added to better control the browser
            identification to web pages using client hints DOM api.
        \li QWebEnginePermission added to manage new and existing website
            permissions. The existing permissions API in QWebEnginePage has
            been deprecated, and replaced by QWebEngineProfile::getPermission()
            and QWebEngineProfile::listPermissions()
        \li Added QWebEngineProfile::setPersistentPermissionsPolicy() to
            control how website permissions persist across browsing sessions.
            By default, incoming permissions are saved to disk.
        \li Added QWebEnginePermission::ClipboardReadWrite and
            QWebEnginePermission::LocalFontsAccess permission types.
        \li QWebEngineCertificateError::isMainFrame() indicates the certificate
            error is from a main or sub frame.
        \li QWebEngineNavigationRequest::hasFormData() added to indicate a
            navigation request sending form data.
        \li QWebEngineSettings::imageAnimationPolicy() added to control image
            animation policy.
    \endlist

    \section1 Tools
    \section2 QDoc Documentation Generator
    \list
        \li You can now use the \c {\keyword} command to link to a section
            title, as a means to improve context sensitive help.
        \li QDoc no longer incorrectly links to non-existing documentation for
            undocumented property access functions.
        \li The build system no longer defines \c QDOC2_COMPAT.
        \li When generating DocBook output, QDoc no longer escapes characters
            multiple times.
        \li The \c {\instantiates} command is deprecated. Use the new
            \c {\nativetype} command instead. The old command now delegates to
            the new one, and QDoc generates a notice about its deprecation.
        \li You can specify \c {auto} as return type for functions as a way to
            mask the full type in the generated documentation.
        \li Improved formatting of the requisites table in API documentation.
        \li QDoc generates less duplicate reports in its output to stdout.
        \li .qhp files now (correctly) contain entries for group items created
            with the \c {\ingroup} command when there is no related \c {\group}
            documentation.
        \li QDoc now generates titles for namespaces in .qhp files, not just for
            classes and types.
        \li QDoc now correctly parses \c {-DDEFINE=VALUE} command line options.
        \li QDoc generates new warnings if:
        \list
             \li qhp subproject indexTitle attribute isn't found.
             \li If the \c {\nativetype} command is used multiple times for the
                 same C++ class.
             \li When generating a file multiple times per project.
             \li Functions previously selected as an overload that aren't
                 explicitly marked with the \c {\overload} command, that due to
                 sorting changes are selected as the primary signature. They
                 must either be documented in full or tagged with the
                 \c {\overload} command.
        \endlist
        \li QDoc no longer warns about undocumented parameters in overloaded
            constructors, and some unnecessary link warnings were removed.
        \li Link warnings now report sensible locations.
        \li QDoc now requires Clang 17 or newer.
        \li The QDoc manual received multiple updates.
        \li You can tag trademarks with the new \c {\tm} command. If you define
            the configuration variable \c {navigation.trademarkspage}, the
            trademark symbol (\c {tm}) becomes a link to that page.
        \li The \c {\deprecated command} now accepts future versions.
        \li QDoc macro arguments now accept formatting commands.
        \li The \c {\compareswith} command now allows for brace-enclosed
            arguments.
        \li The \c {-outputdir} command-line option is now relative to the
            current working directory. Also, the \c {nosubdirs} configuration
            variable no longer mangles what is in \c {outputdir}.
        \li The unused and undocumented \c {clangdefines} configuration variable
            is removed.
        \li QDoc no longer generates \c {.qhp.sha1} files.
        \li QDoc now generates unique references to entries in the table of
            contents.
        \li When generating HTML output, QDoc now only decorates links to API
            entities with \c {translate="no"}.
        \li Name collisions for multi-project documentation builds have been
            reduced. This may impact the generated file names in certain
            configurations.
        \li CMake targets can now be specified with the new
            \c{\qtcmaketargetitem} command.
        \li Support for subscripted function arguments has been removed. This
            feature was undocumented, unused, and bug-ridden. Its removal saves
            the construction and attempted matching of regular expressions on
            every single documented function signature and \c {\a} command
            argument.
        \li Links to function signatures are now more consistent in appearance.
        \li QDoc now supports auto-generated values in QML documentation from
            C++ enums.
        \li The \c {outputprefixes} and \c {outputsuffixes} configuration
            variables now apply to C++ type documentation as well as to QML type
            and module documentation. This can be convenient in multi-module
            documentation configurations where two or more modules define the
            same type names.
    \endlist

    \section1 Platform Changes

    \section2 Desktop Platforms

    \section3 Windows
    \list
        \li Changed the font system to use DirectWrite as the default backend.
            This enables some modern features which were not available with the
            legacy GDI backend. The previous backend is still available and can
            be enabled by passing \c{fontengine=gdi} as parameter to the QPA
            plugin.
    \endlist

    \section3 macOS
    \list
        \li Added support for macOS 15
        \li Added support for safe area margins, both for the camera notch in full
            screen applications, and for windows where the contents extends into
            the titlebar.
        \li Fixed flicker when resizing Qt Quick windows, by presenting Metal layer
            with transaction.
        \li Enabled running animations when resizing Qt Quick windows.
        \li Adopted new NSCursor API for window frame resize cursors
        \li Implemented NSServicesMenuRequestor protocol for Services menu and
            Writing Tools support.
    \endlist

    \section3 Wayland Client on Linux
    \list
        \li Added a new window decoration style that is used on GNOME and uses
            similar styling as GNOME.
        \li Modal status of dialogs is now forwarded to the compositor via the
            new \e {xdg-dialog-v1 protocol}.
        \li Showing a window will now also request activation from the
            compositor (except when Qt::WA_ShowWithoutActivating is set).
        \li Added support to qtwaylandscanner to send null for null QString.
        \li Added options \c PUBLIC_CODE and \c PRIVATE_CODE to
            \l qt6_generate_wayland_protocol_client_sources that control the
            options that are passed to \c wayland-scanner.
        \li Implemented the screen capture feature using ScreenCast service via
            XDG Desktop Portal in Qt Multimedia.
    \endlist

    \section2 Mobile Platforms

            package name.
        \li Updated Gradle to 8.7 and AGP to 8.4.0.
        \li Added support for
            \l {Building an AAR (Android Archive) File}
            {building AAR library packages}.
        \li Deprecated the native Android backend in Qt Multimedia.
        \li When opening libraries with QLibrary, JNI_OnLoad is no longer
            called by default.
        \li \l QtQuickView and QML Embedding:
            \list
                \li Added strong typing support for QtQuickView API.
                \li Added API to manage QML content, under this Java classes
                    under QtQuickView were moved to own classes. This includes:
                    \list
                        \li QtQuickView.SignalListener to QtSignalListener.
                        \li QtQuickView.StatusChangeListener to
                            QtQmlStatusChangeListener.
                        \li QtQuickView Status to QtQmlStatus.
                    \endlist
                \li Added Java classes QtAbstractItemModel,
                    QtAbstractListModel, and QtModelIndex, that wraps
                    QAbstractItemModel, QAbstractListModel, and QModelIndex,
                    respectively.
                \li Added support for QML embedding from a Service.
            \endlist
    \endlist

    \section3 iOS
    \list
        \li Added support for iOS 18
        \li Fixed wrongly reporting UIDevice.currentDevice.orientation via QScreen::orientation()
        \li Improved accessibility integration.
    \endlist

    \section3 visionOS
    \list
        \li Added preliminary support for visionOS.
    \endlist

    \section2 Embedded Platforms

    \section3 QNX
    \list
        \li Added QNX 8.0 support as Technology Preview.
        \li QNX 8.0 doesn't have multimedia support, use \c{-skip qtmultimedia} on configure.
    \endlist

    \section3 VxWorks
    \list
        \li Added VxWorks 24.03 support.
